### About Wordsmith

Wordsmith enables English language learners to input the English vocabulary words they're learning, grouped by subject. After the user inputs words, they can pick a subject (ex. banking or restaurant) and review all the English words associated with that subject. This is convenient when a user needs to run an errand or attend an event. The subject of that errand or event can be pulled up to review the associated words ahead of time to prepare the user to confidently understand and communicate in English. If the user needs a little assistance, they can consult the subject word list during as well.
