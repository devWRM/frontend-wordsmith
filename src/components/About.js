            <h2>ABOUT WORDSMITH</h2>
            <p>Track your English words to increase your vocabulary and improve your communication skills. Study the words of a subject before an event so you're prepared to understand what is spoken and also speak clearly and confidently on that subject. For example, before going to the bank, review the bank subject so you're familiar with words associated with banking. Then you'll be prepared to clearly communicate your banking needs.</p>
